Configuration / Instruction:

1. Place the script in $HOME/bin/ or /usr/local/bin and make it executable.

2. Create a directory $HOME/.inrarec

3. Create a file called $HOME/.inrarec/dontlike and place names of songs and artists in it, that you don't like. 
   You will find an example in this repository. This file should look like this:

  song title - artist
  * - artist
  song title - * 
 
  The syntax is quite obvious:
    - the first example excludes a specific song by a specific artist,
    - the second example excludes any song by a specific artist,
    - the third example excludes a specific song by any artist.
 
  So be aware not to include a line saying "* - *". :)

4. If you previously used fadecut, you can use fadecut's profiles. Just set the variable PROFILEDIR appropriately.
   
   Otherwise, just create the directory $HOME/.inrarec/profiles and place some profiles in there. You will find an 
   example in this repository.

5. Go through the first part of the script and make sure all variables are set correct.

6. Make sure you have installed these programs in your machine:

    - streamripper
    - sox
    - lame
    - id3v2

  Those programs should be available in any Linux distribution.

7. Optional, you can install cdrecord and mkisofs, if you want to burn the downloaded songs to a CRRW

  Important note: this script will burn CD-RW only! No CD-R! 

  The reason for this is a special volume name that is needed to start the automatic burning on headless machines. 
  And you can't set volume names on non-erasable disks, can you? ;)

8. If you want to be notified by e-mail when a recording session is finished, you have to make sure you're machine 
   can send e-mails via smtp.

9. When everything is set correctly, you can start the script by something like this:

  /path/to/inrarec.sh -h 2 -p xyz -d $HOME/tmp/ -cd -k

  This will record two hours (-h 2) of the radio station that is defined in the profile (-p) xyz, 
  store the recorded songs in $HOME/tmp/ (-d) and burn the songs to a cd as well. In addition, 
  it will keep (-k) the original ripped streams by streamripper.

10. Keep fingers crossed not to stumble upon any bug. ;)
