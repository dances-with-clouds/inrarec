Changes:

Version 2017-09-17: 

Switched to ffmpeg for conversion, cutting and fadeing. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2017-09-23: It's "tee" time! ;)

Now, if the command line otion "-usb" is used, the copying to the USB device is done on
the fly by using "tee", which splits the output from ffmpeg into two identical files. 
This saves a lot of time!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2017-09-24:

Inserted an alternative to "tee", just in case it's not installed.
Made more comments and did some "plastic surgery" to make the code look a bit nicer.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2017-10-04:

Bugfix: adding a slash to the find command "find $RECBASEDIR/ ..." is needed 
in case $RECBASEDIR is a link.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2017-11-05:

Bugfix: accidentally I used "-d" for two different options: duration and destination.
Duration is now "-d", while destination now uses "-t", as in target.

Bugfix: corrected the "graft" option for cdrecord

Added a few more options and features:

-burnnewest		        burn the newest recording onto a CD-RW.
-burnoldest		        burn the oldest recording onto a CD-RW. 
-burn <dir>		        burn <dir> onto a CR-RW.
-trim <source> <dest>	process the songs in <source> and write them to <dest>.
			                This option can be used, e.g. if the program
			                crashed after download but before editing the songs.
                      
                      CAUTION: existing files in <dest> will be overwritten!
