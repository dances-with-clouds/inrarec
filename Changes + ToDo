Changes:

Version 2017-09-17: Switched to ffmpeg for conversion, cutting and fadeing. 

version 2017-09-23: It's "tee" time! ;)

Now, if the command line otion "-usb" is used, the copying to the USB device is done on
the fly by using "tee", which splits the output from ffmpeg into two identical files. 
This saves a lot of time!
