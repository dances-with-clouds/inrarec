Changes:

Version 2017-09-17: 

Switched to ffmpeg for conversion, cutting and fadeing. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2017-09-23: It's "tee" time! ;)

Now, if the command line otion "-usb" is used, the copying to the USB device is done on
the fly by using "tee", which splits the output from ffmpeg into two identical files. 
This saves a lot of time!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2017-09-24:

Inserted an alternative to "tee", just in case it's not installed.
Made more comments and did some "plastic surgery" to make the code look a bit nicer.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2017-10-04:

Bugfix: adding a slash to the find command "find $RECBASEDIR/ ..." is needed 
in case $RECBASEDIR is a link.
